## Installing Go (Manual Method) (Recommended)

> This section explains how to manually install Go from the official tarball.

> This is the recomended method because with this you can install the specific version we used that is compatible with the project. **( Version 1.25.0 )**

### 1. Remove Any Existing Go Installation

If you previously installed Go in `/usr/local/go`, remove it to avoid conflicts:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go
```

### 2. Download and Extract Go

Download the Go archive from [https://go.dev/dl/](https://go.dev/dl/).
You need to check and manually set the version you want to install in the below link example.

Example for Go **1.25.0** on Linux (64-bit):

```bash
wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.25.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Extract it into `/usr/local`:

```bash
sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.25.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

> **Note:** Do **not** extract the new Go tarball into an existing `/usr/local/go` directory. This can cause a broken Go installation.

### 3. Update Your PATH

Add Goâ€™s binary directory to your `PATH` so you can run `go` from any terminal.

For **current user only**:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

### 4. Verify Installation

Check that Go is installed and available:

```bash
go version
```

Example output:

```
go version go1.25.0 linux/amd64
```

> If you see the version output, Go is successfully installed! and you can proceed with the CnC Build.

## Building the CnC

> This section provides guidance on how to initialize the go project after installing Go.

> Note: All the commands below should be run in the CNC directory of the project. (Mirai-Botnet/CNC/)

<details>
<summary>Click to See Detailed Steps</summary>

### 1. Making the Build Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x build.sh
```

### 2. Running the Build Script

```bash
./build.sh [debug|release]
```

-   Use `debug` for a debug build (default if no argument is passed).
-   Use `release` for a release build.

> Currently, the script builds the same binary for both debug and release modes. this is the usual behaviour in the original Mirai Botnet.

### 3. Expected Output

The binary and `prompt.txt` will appear in the corresponding output folder (`debug/` or `release/`).

### Handling Dependency Errors While Building

If you encounter errors related to missing dependencies while building, you can manually install them using the following commands:

```bash
go get github.com/mattn/go-shellwords
go get github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

> **Note:**
> If dependencies like `github.com/mattn/go-shellwords` or `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql` are missing or the original repos are deleted, you can use the copies available in this repository.
> (Links to copies are a work in progress.)

</details>

## Additional Notes

> Usually you don't need to change anything in the build script, but if you do, here are some notes:

-   Ensure you have the necessary permissions to run the build script.
-   Ensure that this entire project (`Mirai-Botnet`) is in a directory where you have write access, as it will create output directories and files.
-   We built the CnC using `Go version 1.25.0`, which is compatible with the project, In future if newer versions fail you can try using this version.
-   If you encounter any issues, check the script for any hardcoded paths or environment variables that may need adjustment based on your system configuration.
-   **For example:** If you have Go installed in a non-standard location, you may need to update the `GOPATH` or `GOROOT` variables.
