# Mirai Deployment & Customization Guide (Work In Progress)

This repository provides a **work-in-progress guide and customized Mirai Botnet code** for **educational and research purposes**. The original Mirai code fails in isolated lab/testbench environments, so this repository includes **modifications to make it compatible for safe study**.

> ⚠️ **Note:** Deployment instructions and code examples are under development. Use this repository strictly for **learning and research purposes**, not for any malicious activity.

## About

The goal of this repository is to provide a **research-oriented reference** for studying the Mirai Botnet in a controlled setting. It contains:  
- **Customized Mirai code** adapted for lab/testbench compatibility  
- **Deployment and usage guidance** (work in progress)  
- Tips for safe testing and educational experiments  

This is **not a ready-to-run botnet environment**, and it should only be used in **isolated lab or simulation setups**.
